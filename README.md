##Problem definition 
- There are many known malware families, we need to distinguish between them.
- Members from same family show similar behavior.

##Research objective/ Questions
The goal of our project is to classify between eight malware families which are Trojan, Backdoor, Downloader, 
Worms, Spyware, Adware, Dropper, and Virus. To accomplish this goal, there are several questions we need to answer 
such as what makes the eight families of malware different from each other, what is the behavior of each malware 
family, which algorithm can give us the best performance, and which is best using default hyperparameters or tune it.
